                <p>I am Lisa Postles from the United States of America.  I live in the Midwest region of the country.  I am a speaker of standard English.  </p>

                <p>I have been a speech pathologist for 28 years.  I have worked with many types of clients in order to teach them the proper way to say the sounds of the English language as they are spoken in standard English.</p>

                <p>I hold the Certificate of Clinical Competence.  This is the national license awarded by the American Speech and Hearing Association.  I also hold a teaching license from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. </p>

                <p>I enjoy working with motivated clients who want to learn standard English speech sounds.</p>

                <h2>Information about Accent Modification Training</h2>
                <p>The key to accent modification is identifying which sounds need to be modified, learning how to say the sound so that it sounds like standard English and then practicing until the sound is said naturally in conversation.  I will help you with all 3 steps.  Sessions with me last 20 minutes.  I will identify the sounds you need to learn.  I will show you visually and auditorily how to make the sounds.  I will give you words and exercises to do on your own to help you maintain your new skill. This can all be done via Skype from the comfort of your own home. </p>
                <h3>Fees and Payment</h3>
                <p>After an assessment of your skills in speaking standard English, practice sessions are billed in groups of 3. It typically takes 3 sessions to begin hearing significant change in one's accent. I charge 30€ for 3 sessions, 54€ for 6 sessions and 78€ for 9 sessions. </p>
                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p>I invite you to try a free 30 minute assessment.  Afterward, if you'd like to continue with lessons, I will send you a bill through Paypal with a link where you can easily submit a payment. Just click the "contact me" tab at the top.</p>
